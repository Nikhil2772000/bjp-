                            Taluka of Satara District where I completed my primary education. Owing to my father's
                            official transfer I completed my secondary education from a municipal school in Pimpri and
                            Junior college from S.N.D.T women's college in Pune. I finally completed my Graduation
                            (B.com) from the renowned Symbiosis College in Pune. Along with that, I also received a
                            Doctorate of Social Science from The American University, USA in 2021. I have experienced a
                            very diversified group of friends and colleagues from across religion, color, caste and
                            financial status. Looking back today I feel this massive transition and exposure has helped

                            throughout Maharashtra but also in India as true disciple and follower of 'Samrat Ashoka'.
                            To elevate the economic status of the underprivileged in society, he established the Ashok
                            Nagari Cooperative Bank. I have been managing the responsibilities at this bank, starting
                            from the position of Junior Clerk to now serving as the Chief Manager. The inspiration for
                            social work that I received from my father, along with my experience in the cooperative
                            sector, has enabled me to directly connect with the public and helped me to build a strong
                            bond with them.</p>

                        <p>Due to the Indian constitution laid down by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar it was possible to have
                            reservation for backward class community in elections. Later with the initiative of Shri
                            Sharadchandraji Pawar Saheb there was 50% reservation for women in local body elections. As
                            a result of this I was given an opportunity to contest for Corporation election in PCMC at
                            Sant Tukaram Nagar division 20, and with the support, guidance and blessings from all of you
                            I was elected with huge vote margins in my first attempt in year 2017. Since the beginning I
                            have been working day-night in Municipal Corporation as a representative of ward 20 from the
                            past seven years. I have got the opportunity to work at various platforms in the Municipal
                            Corporation like 'Women & Child Welfare Committee, Law Committee, Education Committee, and
                            City Improvement Committee. Even though I am a part of opposition party in the local body I
                            consider it's my duty to work hard, bring fresh ideas and solutions to make strategic
                            decision without opposition from the government to up lift our society and fulfil basic
                            needs of mankind.

                        <p>With everyone's blessings, in 2019, I was announced as the candidate for the Pimpri Assembly
                            constituency by the Nationalist Congress Party. However, due to some unexpected local
                            political circumstances, I missed that opportunity. Despite this, I did not lose heart. I
                            remained loyal and faithfully worked for the candidates chosen by the party, following the
                            orders given by the party. Those candidates were also elected. A year ago, after the party
                            split, I was the only councillor who remained true to my beliefs, principles, and the will
                            of my beloved voters, and I steadfastly remained loyal to the esteemed Sharad Pawar Saheb.
